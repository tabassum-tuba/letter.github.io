							<pre>               "Suddenly"</pre><br>
Suddenly, you came into my world.<br>
Suddenly, I liked you.<br>
Suddenly, you became the greatest gift of all.<br>

Suddenly, seeing you everyday became my daily routine.<br>



Suddenly, you were irreplaceable.<br>

Suddenly, you meant the world to me.<br>


Suddenly, I took you for granted.<br>
Suddenly, you stop trying for me.<br>
Suddenly, my world fell apart.<br>

Suddenly, I feel lost without you.<br>
Suddenly, you left me, just like that.<br>
Suddenly, it's over.<br>
Suddenly, I would do anything to get you back.<br>

Suddenly, I was forsaken.
Suddenly, you became a memory.<br>
Suddenly, I can't face reality.<br>
Suddenly, you seemed like a stranger.<br>
Suddenly, I cried.<br>
Suddenly, you didn't care.<br>
Suddenly, I lost all hopes.<br>
Suddenly, you are gone.<br>
Forever.<br><br><br>
